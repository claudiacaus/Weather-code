## Project requirements

- The app needs to be a single page application. That means only one index.html file and JavaScript needs to update the html using DOM manipulation.
- The app needs to interact with an API to grab data.
- The app needs to have loading/error handling for the interaction with the API.
- The app needs some user interaction such that you need to grab different data from the API.
- Use more than one API.
- The UI needs to be testable.

## Nice to have

- Should add more features related with the weather.
