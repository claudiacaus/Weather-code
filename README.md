## Project requirements

* The app needs to be a single page application. That means only one index.html file and JavaScript needs to update the html using DOM manipulation.
* The app needs to interact with an API to grab data.
* The app needs to have loading/error handling for the interaction with the API.
* The app needs some user interaction such that you need to grab different data from the API.
* Use more than one API.
* The UI needs to be testable. 

## Nice to have

* Should add more features related with the weather.
